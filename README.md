# Scripps Hackathon Starter

A ready-to-fork template for participants of the [**Scripps Research
2026 Computational Biology & Bioinformatics Hackathon**](https://scripps-cbb.github.io/)
(May 29 – June 1, La Jolla).

It gives you, out of the box:

- A **Claude Code** workspace pre-configured with two specialized skills:
  - `/hackathon-aws` — full context on the hackathon's AWS account
    (VPC, EC2, S3, EICE SSH, Bedrock)
  - `scripps-garibaldi-hpc` — Garibaldi cluster conventions, Slurm
    templates, GPU job patterns
- **Setup guides** for both platforms ([AWS_SETUP.md](AWS_SETUP.md) and
  [HPC_SETUP.md](HPC_SETUP.md))
- **Three "Hello World" exercises** ([hello-world/](hello-world/)) that
  get you fluent with Claude Code (slash commands + auto mode) and
  then validate your HPC and AWS accounts

## Never used GitHub before? Start here.

Welcome! This page is the homepage of a **repository** — a folder of
files tracked by Git. You don't need to learn Git to use this template.
The fastest path:

1. **Get the code on your laptop.**
   - Easiest: click the green **`<> Code`** button at the top right of
     the GitHub page → **Download ZIP** → unzip it somewhere you can
     find again (Desktop is fine).
   - Or, if you're comfortable: `git clone <this-repo-url>`
2. **Install Claude Code** if you haven't already:
   <https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code>
3. **Open this folder in Claude Code.** On Mac/Linux: `cd
   scripps-hackathon-starter && claude`. On Windows: open the folder in
   VS Code with the Claude Code extension installed.
4. Run the **Hello World** exercises below in order. They take ~15
   minutes total and tell you exactly which piece (if any) of your
   setup needs attention.

You'll spend almost all of your hackathon time *talking to Claude in
plain English* — telling it what you want, and letting it run the
commands. The skills in this repo are what make that work for AWS and
HPC specifically.

> **Stuck?** Open Claude Code in this folder and just ask. The skills
> teach Claude what's in this repo, so questions like "what does this
> file do?" or "I got this error — what should I try?" work well.

## Quickstart

### 1. Get fluent with Claude Code (5 minutes)

Open this repo in Claude Code and follow
[hello-world/hello_claude.md](hello-world/hello_claude.md). You'll try
slash commands, switch into auto-accept-edits / plan mode, and run
**auto mode** so you've seen all of it once before it matters.

### 2. Set up the HPC (5 minutes once your account is provisioned)

Follow [HPC_SETUP.md](HPC_SETUP.md). At the end you'll `sbatch
hello_hpc.slurm` and see your job run on a Garibaldi compute node.

### 3. Set up AWS (10 minutes, one-time)

Follow [AWS_SETUP.md](AWS_SETUP.md). At the end you'll run:

```bash
./test_skill.sh
```

It creates an S3 bucket, reads a public dataset, launches and terminates
a tiny EC2 instance, and tells you PASS/FAIL for each step.

### 4. Talk to Claude

Open this repo in Claude Code and try any of these:

```text
/hackathon-aws launch a t3.medium and SSH into it

write me an sbatch script for Garibaldi that runs train.py on 1 GPU for 4 hours

create an S3 bucket called scrippsresearch-<myname>-hackathon and upload my results folder

I got "Token has expired" — what now?
```

The first request hits the AWS slash command. The second auto-loads
the HPC skill. The third works with either, depending on context. The
fourth is just a normal conversation — Claude already knows what to do
because the skills tell it.

---

## How the Claude tooling works (in 60 seconds)

There are two kinds of context-providers in this repo:

- **Slash commands** live in `.claude/commands/`. You invoke them
  explicitly: `/hackathon-aws <your request>`. Use this when you want
  to be sure Claude has the full AWS context loaded.
- **Skills** live in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Claude loads
  them automatically when your question matches the skill's
  description. You don't type anything special — just ask about
  Garibaldi and the cluster skill kicks in.

Both files are plain Markdown — open them and read along if you're
curious. Editing them changes how Claude behaves in your session.

---

## Personalize before you start

A few values in this template point at the maintainer's defaults.
Update them once and the rest of the toolchain follows:

| File | What to change |
|---|---|
| [test_skill.sh](test_skill.sh) | Set `PROFILE` to your SSO profile name, and `BUCKET` to a name that includes your username. |
| [hello-world/hello_aws.py](hello-world/hello_aws.py) | Default `--profile` argument (or pass it on the CLI). |
| [.claude/commands/hackathon-aws.md](.claude/commands/hackathon-aws.md) | The skill references `inewman-wsl` as the example profile — when you start a Claude session, just tell it "use profile `<yours>` for all AWS commands" and it will. No file edit needed. |

If you'd like Claude to remember your profile across sessions, ask it
to save a memory: *"Remember that my AWS profile is `bgood-scripps`."*

## Where to go from here

- Hackathon homepage and schedule: <https://scripps-cbb.github.io/>
- AWS account ID / SSO portal: see [AWS_SETUP.md](AWS_SETUP.md)
- HPC contact: `hpc@scripps.edu` (for Garibaldi account requests)
- Claude Code docs: <https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code>

Good luck and have fun. The whole point of the weekend is to try
something you wouldn't normally try — the tools in this repo are here
so the **infrastructure** isn't what slows you down.
